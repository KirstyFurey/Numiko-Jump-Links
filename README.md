Welcome to the Jump Links test.  

This should fulfil all criteria as requested:  

Open the jump links navigation to see the set of links that they can 'jumplink' down to.  

On clicking those links it will anchor the page down to that section.  

The jumplink nav bar should stick to the top of the window when it reaches the top of the browser window  

The jumplink nav bar should unstick once it has reached the end of the jump-linkable sections (you can assume that the jump-linkable sections will always be grouped together). You will see that there are sections above and below the jump-linkable sections.  

The 'active' section should appear in the jumplink nav bar as they scroll - assume this is when the section is in the middle of the viewport.  

The content inside the sections could be anything from text, images, etc (only text is shown in the demo video). So think about how the title would be associated with a section.  

The user is able to see some visual element that shows their progress through the jumplinkable sections area (note: not the whole page). So its at 0% when the top of the jump-linkable sections comes into view and 100% when the jump-linkable sections goes out of view (see blue bar in video).  

I will admit the final point had me very stuck for a long time, and I did turn to Stack Overflow for assistance!  

Hope you like it!
